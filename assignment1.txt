Linux command to get duplicate word count in a file. Write the output to new file."

the duplicate count where I have first sorted the text present in the file using sort(sort: It is used to sort the data present in the file) and giving 
the sample output to uniq command to count the words by specifying the -c and then used -d to fetch only the duplicate names and then redirecting the 
output to a new file.
